# Haskell-Class-Assignment
A sample of my haskell code from a class assignment.

A class assignment based on deterministic finite automatas (DFAs).

Some functions that were implemented were:

-Determining what the final state is with a given input string transition.

-Determining the next state given one transition.

-Determining the infinite amount of possible transitions from a given string transition.

-Determining if a DFA is finite or not.
